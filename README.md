# Team 13
# General Info:
- Team: Jenn Dorcey, Tom Shaw, Hayley Norton
- Class: cs414
- Game: Monopoly

# Grading Information:
- We have been using "squash and merge" which will make the master appear as though each branch only had a single commit even though this may not be the case 

# Eclipse Setup:
- Clone repo to local machine
- Import as an existing Gradle Project (this will take a bit)
- Right click project -> build path -> configure build path
- Add folder -> /src/main and /src/test

# Building Program:
- Make sure you have a local copy of the repo and are on the Master branch
- run gradle build
- run the Monopoly class using java (will make a gradle task for this)
